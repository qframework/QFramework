QFramework or also called SLD is multi platform framework designed 
to be used to create 3d applications and games on various platforms. 
Its main goal is to simplify design and deployment of 3D applications 
and games across different platforms. 
Framework has built in server that simplifies development of client/server applications.
This project is developed for last 2 years, as personal project. 
Currently, it is used in few simple games that are published on apple and android market. 
As author of this project, I decided to put it public under Apache, Open Source License.
Language used to write client application is JavaScript, while server supports
Python and JavaScript as scripting language.

This project is called Q framework, as short of Queue Developer Framework, 
as it described its internal behavior, or you may say that this work is 
inspired by Q Continuum , where everything should and and will be possible.

I call it also SLD , System for Lazy Development. This comes from my 
approach that I am lazy developer, that I want to achieve much with less work. 
This shortcut has also another meaning, but I will keep that for myself :)

Project is still in early stages, version 0.1 , developed in programmer free time.

P.S.
If somebody guesses what SLD also stands for, I will buy him a .... beer ! Large one... , or two...
